\section{Departure From Shift Alternatives}



\subsection{Logistic Regression and Interactions}

In Figure~\ref{fig:logistic-main-and-interactions} we report the usual power simulation, when generating from the logistic setup, with both main effects and second order interactions.
We emphasize that all tests are performed in the original $x$ space, i.e., ignore the presence of interactions.

Formally, the logistic assumption implies that 
$P(Y=1|x)=\exp(\eta)/[1+\exp(\eta)]$.
Main-effects and second order interaction imply that 
$\eta=x'\beta+x'Bx$, for some $p$-vector $\beta$, and symmetric matrix $B$.
We also assume $X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_{p\times p})$.

From Figure~\ref{fig:logistic-main-and-interactions} we see that in the logistic setup, with interactions, two-group tests still dominate. 

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{"art/file42"}
	\caption{\textbf{Logistic Regression. Main effects and interactions.} 
		Data generated via 
		$Y|x \sim Binom(1,p(x));p(x)=\exp(\eta)/[1+\exp(\eta)];\eta=x'\beta+x'Bx; X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_{p\times p})$.  } 
	\label{fig:logistic-main-and-interactions}
\end{figure}

The logistic assumption differs from our original setup in that the logistic assumption states $Y|x$, instead of $X|y$, as in Fisher's LDA setup. 
The logistic assumption implies that $X_0$ is no longer a shifted versions of $X_1$, even in the presence of main effects alone. 
I.e., when $B$ is a $p\times p$ matrix of zeroes.
While not a ``pure shift'', we expect that lacking interactions, the logistic model is very close to a shift. 
This is verified in Figure \ref{fig:logistic-main-only}.


\begin{figure}[th]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{"art/file40"}
	\caption{\textbf{Logistic Regression. Main effects only.} 
		Data generated via 
		$Y|x \sim Binom(1,p(x));
		p(x)=\exp(\eta)/[1+\exp(\eta)];
		\eta=x'\beta; 
		X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I_{p\times p})$.  } 
	\label{fig:logistic-main-only}
\end{figure}


It is possible to use the logistic setup to generate data with no shift at all. 
For instance, if $\eta=\beta_0+x'x$. 
In this case, $X_1$ is a rescaled version $X_0$, depicted for $p=2$ in Figure~\ref{fig:quadratic-form}.
This example is typically encountered in the machine learning literature, to motivate learning with kernels. 

When analyzing the quadratic form logistic regression we need to distinguish between analysis in the original $x$ space, and in the augmented interaction space. 
In the original space, $X_0$ is a ``pure rescaling'' of $X_1$. 
In particular, tests for shifts, or linear classifiers are ill equipped for this setup.
The only tests that deal with this are the GOF tests, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:logistic-interactions-only}.
When augmenting the $x$ space with interactions, then the problem collapses to a linear regression with main effects only. Figure~\ref{fig:logistic-interactions-only-augmented} thus resembles Figure~\ref{fig:logistic-main-only}.

		X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I_{p\times p})$.
	}
	\label{fig:dependence_1}
\end{figure}







\subsection{Mixture Class}

Another example where $X_1$ is not a shifted version of $X_0$ is a mixture class. 
\cite{golland_permutation_2003} and \cite{golland_permutation_2005} study accuracy-tests using simulation, neuroimaging data, genetic data, and analytically.
The finite Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis dimension requirement \cite[Sec 4.3]{golland_permutation_2005} implies a the problem is low dimensional and prevents the permutation p-value from (asymptotically) concentrating near $1$. 
They find that the power increases with the size of the test set.
This is seen in Fig.4 of \cite{golland_permutation_2005}, where the size of the test-set, $K$, governs the discretization. 
We attribute this to the reduced discretization of the accuracy statistic.

When discussing the power of the resubstitution accuracy, \cite{golland_permutation_2005} simulate power by sampling from a Gaussian mixture family of models, and not from a location family as our own simulations. 
Under their model (with some abuse of notation)
\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
x_1 & \sim \pi \gauss{\mu_1,I}+ (1-\pi) \gauss{\mu_2,I}, \\
x_0 & \sim (1-\pi) \gauss{\mu_1,I}+ \pi \gauss{\mu_2,I}.
\end{split}
\end{align*}
Varying $\pi$ interpolates between the null distribution $(\pi=0.5)$ and a location shift model $(\pi=0)$. 
We now perform the same simulation as \cite{golland_permutation_2005}, but in the same dimensionality of our previous simulations.
We re-parameterize so that $\pi=0$ corresponds to the null model:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:mixture_alternative}
x_1 & \sim (1/2-\pi) \gauss{\mu_1,I}+ (1/2+\pi) \gauss{\mu_2,I}, \\
x_0 & \sim (1/2+\pi) \gauss{\mu_1,I}+ (1/2-\pi) \gauss{\mu_2,I}.	
\end{split}
\end{align}
From Figure~\ref{fig:file12}, we see that for the mixture class of \cite{golland_permutation_2005} locations tests are still preferred over accuracy-tests.

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{"art/file12"}
	\caption{\textbf{Mixture Alternatives.} $\x_i$ is distributed as in Eq.(\ref{eq:mixture_alternative}).

		The effect, $\pi$, is color and shape coded and varies over $0$ (red circle), $1/4$ (green triangle) and $1/2$ (blue square). }
	\label{fig:file12}
\end{figure}




\section{Departure from Homoskedasticity and Scalar Invariance}

Our previous simulations assume variables have unit variance. 
Practitioners are already accustomed to z-score features before learning a regularized predictor (e.g. ridge regression) so this is not an unrealistic setup.
Implicit z-scoring is sometime an integral part of a test statistic. 
This is known as \emph{scalar invariance}.
The \emph{Srivastava} statistic, for instance, is scalar invariant. 
It can be (roughly) thought of as the $l_2$ norm of the $p$-vector of coordinate-wise t-statistics.
The \emph{Goeman} statistic, for instance, is not scalar invariant. 
It can be (roughly) thought of as the $l_2$ norm of the $p$-vector of variable-wise mean differences.
Under heteroskedasticity, the \emph{Goeman} statistic will give less importance to signal in the high-variance directions than signal in the low-variance directions. 
\emph{Srivastava} will give all coordinates the same importance.

In Figure~\ref{fig:heteroskedastic_11} we can see the difference between the scalar-invariant \emph{Srivastava} and \emph{Goeman} statistics. 
We also see that two-group tests dominate accuracy-tests also in the heteroskedastic case.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Heteroskedasticity: $\Sigma$ is diagonal with $\Sigma_{jj}=j$.}	
	\label{fig:heteroskedastic}	
\end{figure}




\subsection{Tie Breaking}
\label{sec:ties}

As previously stated, the accuracy statistic is highly discrete. 
Discrete test statistics lose power by not exhausting the permissible false positive rate. 
A common remedy is a \emph{randomized test}, in which the rejection of the null is decided at random in a manner that exhausts the false positive rate. 
Formally, denoting by $\mathcal{T}$ the observed test statistic, by $\mathcal{T}_\pi$, its value after under permutation $\pi$, and by $\mathbb{P}\{A\}$ the proportion of permutations satisfying $A$ then the randomized version of our tests imply that if the permutation p-value, 
$\mathbb{P}\{\mathcal{T}_\pi \geq \mathcal{T}\}$, 
is greater than  $\alpha$ then we reject the null with probability 
$$ max\left\{\frac{\alpha - \mathbb{P}\{\mathcal{T}_\pi > \mathcal{T}\}}{\mathbb{P}\{\mathcal{T}_\pi = \mathcal{T}\}},0 \right\}.$$

Figure~\ref{fig:file33} reports the same analysis as in Figure~\ref{fig:file2}, after allowing for random tie breaking. 
It demonstrates that the power disadvantage of accuracy-tests, cannot be remedied by random tie breaking.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{art/file33}
	\caption{The same as Figure~\ref{fig:file2}, with random tie breaking.}
	\label{fig:file33}
\end{figure}





\section{Sparse Alternatives}
\label{sec:sparse}

In our set of simulations we discussed ``dense'' alternatives, in the sense that all coordinates carry signal.
Dense alternatives are motivated by neuroimaging where most brain locations in a regions carry signal.
In a genetic application, a ``sparse'' alternative may be more plausible. 
Figure~\ref{fig:sparse} reports power when $\mu$ is sparse. 
As usual, two-group tests dominate accuracy-tests, only this time, the winners are not the $T^2$ type statistics, but rather, the tests for sparse shifts (\emph{Cai}, \emph{Simes}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{"art/file34"}
	\caption{Sparse $\mu$.}  
	\label{fig:sparse}	
\end{figure}





\section{Fixed SNR}
\label{sec:fix_snr}

For a fair comparison between simulations, in particular between those with different $\Sigma$, we needed to fix the difficulty of the problem.
We fix the Kullbackâ€“Leibler Divergence between distributions of sample means. 
Abusing notation, we fix $KL[\bar x_1,\bar x_0]=c^2 p$, which is the same as fixing $\Vert \mu \Vert^2_\Theta$, with the exception of the large sample (\ref{sec:large-sample}) and the heavytailed analysis (\ref{sec:heavytailed}). 

Our choice implies that the Euclidean norm of $\mu:=\mathbb{E}(x_1)-\mathbb{E}(x_0)$ varies with $\Sigma$, with the sample size, and with the direction of the signal.
An initial intuition may suggest that detecting signal in the low variance PCs is easier than in the high variance PCs. 
This is true when fixing $\Vert \mu \Vert_2$, but not when fixing $\Vert \mu \Vert_{\Theta}$.

For completeness, Figure~\ref{fig:dependence_4} reports the power analysis under $AR(1)$ correlations, but with $\Vert \mu \Vert_2$ fixed.
We compare the power of a shift in the direction of some high variance PC (Figure~\ref{fig:dependence_41}), versus a shift in the direction of a low variance PC (Figure~\ref{fig:dependence_42}).
The intuition that it is easier to detect signal in the low variance directions is confirmed.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Short memory, AR(1) correlation. $\Vert \mu \Vert_2$ fixed. }	
	\label{fig:dependence_4}		
\end{figure}

Other authors have also observed the need for fixing the SNR for a fair comparison between tests.
In \cite{ramdas2015decreasing}, authors prefer to use sparse alternatives.
With sparse alternatives, the difficulty of the problem is governed by the sparsity of the signal and not only the dimension of the data. 
In \cite{chen2010two}, authors fix $\Vert \mu \Vert_2^2/\Vert \Sigma \Vert^2_{Frob}$ where $\Vert \Sigma \Vert^2_{Frob}=\Tr(\Sigma'\Sigma)$ is the Frobenius matrix norm. 
Clearly, $\Vert \mu \Vert_2^2/\Vert \Sigma \Vert^2_{Frob}$ is invariant to the direction of the signal with respect to the noise. 
For this reason, we prefer fixing $\Vert \mu \Vert_\Theta$.
