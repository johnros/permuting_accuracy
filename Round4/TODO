- Simulate interaction:
    - Why isn't the null 5% ?!? Augmenting the design, even if multiplying by 0, adds signal?
    - Do groups need to be balanced and how to make sure of that? file40 is not balanced and looks ok, so not a matter of balance.
    - Are the hypotheses two sided?
- Upward bias in two-group tests.
- Large sample (X100)
